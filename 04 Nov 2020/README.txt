A basic way to use ther QM machie is poke in a unsolved matrix and see which ones are lowest energy answers.

These programs pull a hard coded matrix on purpose as chaging one line is easy enough. the input is
a .qbo look around for some in the directory structure.

in the WWW ide just:
python whatevername.py

runs it.

you see CTRL keys to poke text into the IDE made up of reused visual studio. the PASTE doesnt quite work, it does say that someplace.
