Your free Leap minute is almost up!

We hope you have found the demos, tools, and interactive examples useful, and have already run some code on the D-Wave quantum computer.  As a reminder, your free minute on the D-Wave quantum computer expires one month after signup. When your time expires, you can no longer submit problems to the quantum computer. This includes running the demos and interactive examples available through Leap, because these run on the quantum computer too. 

The good news is that you can earn an additional free minute each month by agreeing to open-source the code you develop using our tools, and providing your GitHub credentials through Leap. If you need more than one minute per month on the D-Wave quantum computer, upgrade to our Commercial Plan.
