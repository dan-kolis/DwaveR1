2209.png is important !

you can use this WWW as oper the URLS to do a lot without even having a python environent on your computer.

the 'bill' does not include non QM time. If you dont call the functions you can edit and try things and run your programs without using up the budget.

the telnet like sesison gives you a vertuasl linux box thats super full featured really.

So you can hop from the pull down source code editing to the telnet session. "terminal" I suppose really...

Don't give up and make a IDE until you get at least a few programs to run 'all the way' this way.
