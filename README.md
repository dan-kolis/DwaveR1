There are currently two ways to get at the QM boxes at DWAVE.

* One is a WWW style thing called LEAP and the 
* Other some other named idea, Pegasys, maybe !

Until you get the idea of the way the thing works, the WWW IDE is **VERY fine** for small programs. 

Why have to learn a new working concept and new kind of computer at the same time ?

The Ide gives you a remote VM with visual code as a front end and a telnet command line. Its really,
really carefully made.

You can rename the directories, move around the exmaples etc. this is 'your copy'.

My entries here fall into three categories:

1) Solving Sudoko puzzles
2) Solcing N queens problems
3) Solving Q matrix questions without fixed purposes.

Also some DW examples have been renamed.

I suggest you work thru the examples in order by date.

You can email me anytime too: dankolis@gmail.com is more convienent for daily corresp, then the one in the GIT universe.

QM might be pretty cool, get into the game with the nice free sample. a minute a month etc is lots of time the ways its accounted.

Good luck !

Look for README in the directories too, obviously.
