## Fun with Quantum Canadian Computers

Hi Im Dan Kolis writing this 14 Dec 2020 20:00 Z

There are currently two ways to get at the QM boxes at DWAVE.

https://www.dwavesys.com/

* One is a WWW style thing called LEAP and the 
* Other some other named idea, Pegasys, maybe !

Until you get the idea of the way the thing works, the WWW IDE is **VERY fine** for small programs. 

The usual access is 100% Pyrthon, and the numPy matrix package is the usual way to interface your queries.

Note you can test programs ion the IDE and not burn off any time by jumping around the QM low level, you
know comment out set flags, etc. Most program changes are you go are not real solutions, there tinkering with 'other', so do that and there save in the VM copy you get as you go.

In case the account dries up under you ahhh save you work on your computers too once in a while !

Why have to learn a new working concept and new kind of computer at the same time ?

The Ide gives you a remote VM with visual code as a front end and a telnet command line. Its really,
really carefully made.

You can rename the directories, move around the examples etc. this is 'your copy'.

My entries here fall into three categories:

1) Solving Sudoko puzzles
2) Solcing N queens problems
3) Solving Q matrix questions without fixed purposes.

Also some DW examples have been renamed.

I suggest you work thru the examples in order by date. Theres a bit of help ideas throughout my submission. Use the telenet like command line, by an adult and realize text interfaces get you there faster then endless art project click and wonder screens !

You can email me anytime too: dankolis@gmail.com is more convienent for daily corresp, then the one in the GIT universe.

QM might be pretty cool, get into the game with the nice free sample. a minute a month etc is lots of time the ways its accounted.

Good luck !

Look for README in the directories too, obviously.
