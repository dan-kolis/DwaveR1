There are currently two ways to get at the QM. One is a WWW style thing called LEAP and the other some other named idea.

Until you get the idea of the names and so on, the WWW IDE is fine for small programs. Why have to learn a new split
concept work system first thing.

You can rename the directories, move around the exmaples etc. this is 'your copy'.

My entries here fall into three categories:

1) Solving Sudoko puzzles
2) Solcing N queens problems
3) Solving Q matrix questions without fixed purposes.

Also some DW examples have been renamed.

I suggest you work thru the examples in order by date.

You can email me anytime too: dankolis@gmail.com is more convienent for dfaily corresp then the one in the GIT universe.

Good luck !

Look for README in the directories too, obviously.
